> Steven Jobs: Speech in Standford - 7.23 2019
I am honored to be with you today at the commencement from one of the finest universities in the world.
I never graduated from college. Truth be told, this is the closest I've ever gotten to a college graduation.
Today I want to three stories from my life. That's it. No big deal. Just three stories.

- The first story is about connecting the dots.
I dropped out of Reed College after the first six months, but then stayed around as a drop-in for another 18 months or so
before I really quit.So why did I drop out?
It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unwed college graduate student, and she decided to put me up for adoption.
She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth
by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last time that they really wanted a girl.
So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: "We have an unexpected baby boy, do you want him?"
They said: "Of course." My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father
had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoptions papers. She only relented a few months later when my parents
promised that I would someday go to college.
And 17 years later I did go to college. But I naively chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and all of my working-class
parents' saving were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it.
I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out.
And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that
it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.
The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the requiring class that didn't interest me,
and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.

It wasn't all romantic, I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the 5$ deposits
to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple.
I love it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.
Let me give you one example:
Reed College at that time offered perhaps the best calligraphy instruction in the country. Throughout the campus every poster,
every label on every drawer, was beautiful hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes,
I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about what makes great
typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.

None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer,
it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography.
If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts.
And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no personal computer would have them.
If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have
the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college.
But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.

Again, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that
the dots will somehow connect in your future. You have to trust in something--your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.
This approach has never let me down, and it has made all the difference in my life.

- My second story is about love and loss.
I was lucky--I found what I loved to do early in life. Woz and I started Apple in my parents garage when I was 20.
We worked hard,  and in 10 years Apple had grown from just the two of us in a garage into a $2 billion company with over 4000 employees.
We had just released our finest creation--the Macintosh--a year earlier, and I had just turned 30. And then I got fired.
How can you get fired from a company you started? Well, as Apple grew we hired someone who I thought was very talented to
run the company with me, and for the first year or so things went well. But then our visions of the future began to diverge
and eventually we had a falling out. When we did, out Board of Directors sided with him.
So at 30 I was out. And very publicly out. What had been the focus of my entire adult life was gone, and it was devastating.

I really didn't know what to do for a few months. I felt that I had let the previous generation of entrepreneurs down--that I had
dropped the baton as it was being passed to me. I met with David Packard and bob Noyce and tried to apologize for screwing up so badly.
I was a very public failure, and I even thought about running away from the valley. But something slowly began to dawn on me--I still
love what I did. The turn of events at Apple had not changed that one bit. I had been rejected, but I was still in love.
And so I decided to start over.

I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me.
The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything.
It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.

During the next five years, I started a company named NeXT, another company named Pixar, and fell in love with an amazing woman
who would become my wife. Pixar went on to create the worlds first computer animated feature film, Toy Story, and is now
the most successful animation studio in the world. In a remarkable turn of events, Apple bought NeXT, I returned to Apple,
and the technology we developed at NeXT is at the heart of Apple's current renaissance.
And Laurene and I have a wonderful family together.

I'm pretty sure none of this would have happened if I hadn't been fired from Apple. It was awful tasting medicine, but I guess
the patient needed it.
I'm convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did. You've got to find what you love.
And that is as true for your work as it is for your lovers.
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly to do great work is to love what you do.
If you haven't found it yet, keep looking, don't settle.
As with all matters of the heart, you'll know when you find it. And, like any great relationship,
it just gets better and better as the years roll on. So keep looking until you find it. Don't settle.

- My third story is about death.
When I was 17, I read a quote that went something like: "If you live each day as if it was your last, someday you'll most
certainly be right." It made an impression on me, and since then, for the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror
every morning and asked myself: "If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"
And whenever the answer has been "No" for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.

Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.
Because almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things
just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important.
Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.
You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.

About a year ago, I was diagnosed with cancer. I had a scan at 7:30 in the morning, and it clearly showed a tumor on my pancreas.
I didn't even know what a pancreas was. The doctors told me this was almost certainly a type of cancer that is incurable,
and that I should expect to live no longer than three to six months, My doctor advised me to go home and get my affairs in order,
which is doctor's code for prepare to die. It means to try to tell your kids everything you thought you'd have the next 10 years
to tell them in just a few months. It means to make sure everything is buttoned up so that it will be as easy as possible
for your family. It means to say your goodbyes.

I lived with that diagnosis all day. Later that evening I had a biopsy, where they stuck an endoscope down my throat,
through my stomach and into my intestines, put a needle into my pancreas and got a few cells from the tumor.
I was sedated, but my wife, who was there, told me that when they viewed the cells under a microscope the doctors started
crying because it turned out to be a very rare form of pancreatic cancer that is curable with surgery.
I had the surgery and I'm fine now.

This was the closest I've been to facing death, and I hope it's the closest I get for a few more decades.
Having lived through it, I can now say this to you with a bit more certainly than
when death was a useful but purely intellectual concept:

No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there.
And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it.
And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life's change agent.
It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now,
you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite ture.

Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.
Don't be trapped by dogma--which is living with the results of other people's thinking.
Don't let the noise of other's opinions drawn out your own inner voice.
And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.
They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.

When I was young, there was an amazing publication called The Whole Earth Catalog, which was one of the bibles of my generation.
It was created by a fellow named Stewart Brand not far from here in Menlo Park, and he brought it to life with poetic touch.
This was in the late 1960's, before personal computers and desktop publishing, so it was all made with typewriters, scissors,
and polaroid cameras. It was sort of like Google in paperback form, 35 years before Google came along: it was idealistic,
and overflowing with neat tools and great notions.

Stewart and his team put out several issues of The Whole Earth Catalog, and then when it had run its course,
they put out a final issue. It was the mid-1970s, and I was your age.
On the back cover of their final issue was a photograph of an early morning country road,
the kind you might find yourself hitchhiking on if you were so adventurous. Beneath it were the words:
"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish."
It was their farewell message as they signed off. Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish
And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you.

Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish. Thank you all very much.

> A Brief History of World Commercial Fishing    ★★★
As is shown in the pictures, we can see clearly that with the increase of commercial fishing, the amount of fishes steeply decreased.
In one picture, there was a great deal of fish and only one fishing-boat in 1990.
On the contrary, in 1995 there was only one fish, but lots of fishing-boat.

The purpose of this picture is to tell us that we should pay more attention to the current condition of ocean resources.
As a result of over-fishing, the amount of fishes has obviously decreased, compare to 1990.
We won't know where fish is in the future if we let this situation go as it is.
By that time, our environment will suffer a great destruction.

Consequently, it is imperative for us to take drastic measures.
For one thing, our authorities should make more strict laws to restrict commercial fishing.
For another, we should enhance the awareness of people that the ocean resources are really critical to us and to realize the significance of sustainable developing.
Only in this way can we protect our ocean resources and able to see more fishes in the future pictures.
Also, I convinced that we, human beings, can improve this situation and will have a bright future.

> An American girl in Chinese costume    ★★★★★
The picture vividly depicts a lovely American girl in traditional Chinese costume with a sweet smile on her face.
She wears ribbons, necklaces and other accessories that are characteristic of the clothes of a certain Chinese minority group.
Undoubtedly, the costume has added oriental charm to her beautiful features.

What the picture conveys goes far beyond merely a new fashion trend.
Instead, it carries cultural blending implications as well.
The fact that people from different countries are attracted to mysterious Chinese culture indicates that to some extent a culture can be accepted, respected, appreciated and shared internationally.
In other words, a nation's unique/distinctive culture can become international through world wide economic and cultural exchanges.
Since the trend of globalization becomes irresistible, the increasing cultural exchanges can effectively improve mutual understanding and friendship.

It is my view that national culture as priceless spiritual treasure should be preserved and cherished.
Meanwhile, there are good reasons to advocate international culture for those ideas from the other cultures, controversial or even absurd at first sight, can provide a different perspective for us to observe the world in the long run.
Nevertheless, where we are confronted with a different culture, we should be sensible enough to absorb its essence and to resist its dark side.
Only in this way can we promote cultural development positively and make our world multidimensional, colorful and vigorous.

> Idol Worship    ★★★
As is vividly depicted in the photos above, Beckham, the smart British football superstar, is enjoying a striking popularity among the adolescents.
In the first picture, Beckham's name appears on a young man's face.
The caption indicates that worship for the idol is written on the face.
In the second photograph, another young people is doing Beckham's chic hairstyle in a barbershop.
We are informed that he is spending 300 yuan imitating his idol's haircut.

Undoubtedly, the picture have subtly reflected the social phenomenon that idol worship is prevalent among the teenagers nowadays.
Beckham represents the image of sport hero whose handsome appearance and unparalleled football skills are passionately adored by all the sports fans.
Likewise, several teenage girls won their fame overnight in the 2005 Super Girl Contest in China, which provoked nationwide noisy debates on the value and harm of admiring these idols.
Briefly speaking, young people are inclined to idolize the people who excel in appearance, intelligence or talent.

Hence, idolatry, the thought-provoking social phenomenon, is a double-edged sword which can exert profound influence on the growth of young people.
If we simply worship the idols by imitating their hairstyle or pursuing fashions unreasonably, the obsession will certainly waste us a great deal of time and money, endangering the efficiency of our work.
On the contrary, we will lead a positive and fruitful life if we endeavor to improve ourselves by bridging the gap between our models and us.
Accordingly, the latter attitude should be adopted to direct our way of life.

> Master of Engineering    ★★★★★
The diagram above clearly illustrates that dramatic elevation has occurred in the recruitment of Master of Engineering(ME) in the past seven years.
According to the statistics given above, we may conclude that the recruitment of ME was on steady rise from 1998 to 2004.
In 1998, the number was at a low level, only about 2500.
Surprisingly, it reached to more than 35000 in 2004 within no more than seven years.

Some driving factors that contribute to the above-mentioned changes may be summarized as follows.
First and foremost, China has become particularly active in manufacturing, which leads to the increased demand of qualified engineers.
In addition, the development of job market on the whole cannot keep pace with the expansion of college graduates, which obliges a large number of students to stay on campus for another three years to get better prepared for their career.
Last but not least, working pressure is another reason.
Taking all these factors into account, we may predict that with speedy development of our society, the number of recruitment of ME will keep growing in the forthcoming decade.

On the other side of the coin, however, this tendency may bring about a good many problems, such as the waste of talent.
It is necessary for us to take effective measures to ensure this situation doesn't get out of hand, and encourage students to choose majors in which theoretical knowledge and practical skills will be demanded in the job market.

> Self-Confidence    ★★★★★
It is symbolically illustrated in the cartoon that a striker is preparing to shoot at the goal defended by a goalkeeper on a football field.
In the goalkeeper's mind, he is so much smaller than he actually is that guarding the goal becomes a mission impossible.
On the contrary, the giant guard seems to fill up the whole goal in the attacking player's mind.

The purpose of the drawing is to show us that in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges or predicament, possessing self-confidence is of utmost significance.
Regardless of how much success one has had in school or at work, there are bound to be times when he or she will encounter problems.
It is at these critical times that his self-confidence, towards difficultly and life in general, eventually plays a crucial role in determining whether he can turn failure into victory.

I can think of no better illustration than the following one.
Helen Keller was born deaf, dumb and blind, certainly nothing to give her self-confidence.
Nevertheless, she went on to conquer her multiple handicaps to finally become a writer and lecturer, to become an inspiration to all.
This case effectively clarifies that no matter what tasks we are confronted with, we should never overestimate the difficulties or underestimate our abilities.

> Choice    ★★★
As is vividly shown in the cartoon, for undergraduate college students, deciding what to do upon graduation can be a tough decision to say the least.
For the vast majority of students, the choice is among finding a job, pursuing postgraduate studies, going abroad or starting one's own career.
And below the drawing, there is a topic which says: "Choice".

When making the decision, students should consider a variety of factors, including their personal preferences, financial status and career plans.
The first factor that they should consider is their own personal preferences.
Some students may have entrepreneurial ambitions and dream of running their own business.
The second factor that undergraduate students should consider is their financial situation.
Some students or their families are able to support the tuition fee of postgraduate studies or studying overseas, while for others it would be too much of financial strain.
The final factor that students should take into account is their intended career.
Students who make the wrong choice could be faced with disappointing career prospects, or end up wasting their time and money.

When it comes time for university graduates to decide their next step in life, there is no one right or wrong choice for everyone.
Rather, each student must reach his or her own conclusion and picking the route which is the most proper for themselves.
With due consideration of personal preferences, financial status and career goals, students can improve their chances of making optimal choice.

> Mutual Support    ★★★★
In the first cartoon, three decades ago, along the road walked a young and vigorous mother, leading her beloved daughter hand in hand, with a sweet smile on her beautiful face.
On the contrary, nowadays the daughter in the prime of her life is supporting her aged mother with her firm arm in the second portrayal.
And below the drawing, there is a topic which says: "mutual support".

The aim of the picture is to illustrate that practicing filial piety is of great importance in our current society.
For one thing, we have inherited this world from our parents and grandparents.
If not for the hard work of the past generations, including the aged among us, the modern society that we enjoy today would not be possible.
For another, the senior citizens have worked hard to provide for their families, for society and for young generations.
The majority of them have led struggles to create their better living and working conditions for posterity.

To sum up, it is tradition in China to respect the elderly and to take care of the young.
It can be exemplified by giving up our seats on the bus for someone older, by inviting our parents to live with us once they retire, and listening to their advice about personal or work problems.
Although some of the Chinese traditions are disappearing, one tradition should never fade away is that of looking after the elderly.

> Gathering in an era of Mobile Phone    ★★★★
As is shown in the portrayal, four youngsters are sitting at a table, being ready to have meal.
Unfortunately, instead of drinking and eating in front of a variety of delicious and nutritious dishes, each of them is holding a mobile phone and staring at the screen, with no thought of chatting or eating at all.
We are informed: Gathering in an era of mobile phone.

Like the Internet, mobile phones benefit people hugely.
With mobile phones, the home will become a library, a school, an office and an entertainment center.
All transactions, from banking to shopping, will be performed electronically and all information, from train schedules to discount-price goods, will be as close as the press of a key.
On the contrary, despite the increase in efficiency and convenience generated by digital products, the changes it brings could very well lead to potentially adverse consequence.
For instance, as nearly all activities could be conducted on mobile phones, we could all become a hermit-like, never feeling any need to leave the screen.
This would be unfortunate because we will become so addicted to virtual world that we might never be exposed to social interaction in reality.

From the preceding discussion, it is readily apparent that mobile phone, as an increasingly popular form of communication among people, has both its upsides and downsides.
To be sure, the mobile phone can be used by young people in productive and useful ways.
However, the adolescents must be sure to limit the time they spend on digital products, or their academic work and social life will eventually pay the price.

> Set An Example    ★★★★
In the pictures above are a father and his beloved son.
In the left cartoon, smoking a cigarette and sitting in a sofa comfortably, the father is watching a football match on TV and shouting: "Son, study hard for me!"
On the contrary, in the right portrayal, the father is studying together with his son, both totally absorbed in their books at 9 p.m.
The caption indicates, "Instead of merely making a request, set an example."

The purpose of the pictures is to show us that utmost significance should be attached to practicing what you preach.
On the one hand, parents teach much more by their actions than by their words.
Some of them may say to their children, "don't say four-letter words about so and so," but before long the children may hear them criticize their friends and neighbors with bad language.
On the other hand, parenting is such a crucial responsibility, yet there are no required courses to prepare one to undertake this role in life.
The only learning is the example from one's own parents.

To sum up, parents are the best teachers.
Obviously, if parents' actions don't conflict with their own words, they would have the opportunity to be outstanding examples of their children.
Just as an old saying goes: "Action speaks louder than words."

> Possessing Books    ★★★★★
In the cartoons above are two men treating books in completely diverse ways.
In the first caricature, facing hundreds of books on the shelf, a man is speaking proudly: "I have so many books!"
On the contrary, in the second drawing, facing merely one book in the desk, another person is talking to himself: "I will exert my effort to finish reading 20 books this year."
We are informed: "Owning Books and Reading Books."

The aim of the portrayals is to show us that action speaks louder than words.
Ambition is nothing without action, whereas action is perfectly possible without ambition as is evidenced by impulsive people.
Let us consider for instance Leonardo Da Vinci.
In his life he created many brilliant works of art and invented many machines that surpassed the technology of his time, such as the helicopter.
If he had only been an ambitious man, he would have no doubt left us with nice artifacts.
Yet, Da Vinci as a man of action who could not sit still, so he produced a dazzling legacy of painting and inventions.

Generally speaking, ambition and action are both essential in determining whether we flourish or fall behind.
The former give us the drive and direction to move forward, while the latter enables us to implement our vision and make the things happen.
Just as the famous British philosopher John Locke said, "The actions of men are the best interpreters of their thoughts."

> Resign & Apology Letter
Dear Mr.Wang,
    I am much grateful to be employed by you two months ago as an editor for your magazine Design & Fashions.
I appreciate the opportunity of having worked here with you and other colleagues.
The experiences will be unforgettable throughout my life.
    However, as a young man whose primary interest is in computer science rather than fashion designing, I find my present job doesn't fall in with my previous training and strength.
I therefore decide to quit this job for something else that may conform to my educational background.
    Please accept my sincere apologies for any inconvenience my leaving may cause.
                                                                                                             Your truly,
                                                                                                             Li Ming

> Apology & Advice Letter
Dear Bob,
    I'm writing to apologize for having forgotten to return the "the Beatles" CD to you when I left Canada.
I was in such a hurry that I packed everything in my luggage without checking carefully.
Had I paid more attention then, I wouldn't have made such a stupid mistake.
    Now something must be done to solve this problem because I understand you cherish the CD enormously.
I can either send it to you by express mailor alternatively compensate you a reasonable price.
If you do not mind, I may bring it back to you next time I go Canada.
    Please let me know which solution you prefer at your earliest convenience.
I really hope you will accept my sincere apology.
                                                                                                       Faithfully yours,
                                                                                                       Li Ming
