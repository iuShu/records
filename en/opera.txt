>>> The Fold
All the years that you have wasted
now you want them all back
long ago you stopped counting
because you couldn't keep track
you were faced with the future
there is bright sun
but the present, is that melting
You decided to run
don't you fold
when the mountain is high
when the river is wide
don't you fold
when you out of your mind
when you walking the line
and Oasis in the desert
run clear
and the only way to see it
it's to believe that it's there
where we are fight our battle
not matter where you cate.

you're the only one to blame
don't you fold
when the mountain is height
when the river is wide
don't you fold


and all this time
i was living the lie
i was
but I know
changing the time
all the
heart and the mind
don't you fold
when the mountain is height
when the river is wide
don't you fold
when you out of your mind
when you walking the line
don't you fold
when ..
when ..
don't you fold
when you out of ..
when ..
don't you fold
don't you fold

her long hair
And then she asked me, Do I like all right

I see i'll be in your right
I'll be wonderful because i see
the love light in your eyes

To find words to go along with melody
But this time there's actually something on my mind
So please forgive these few brief awkward lines
Since I met you, my whole life was changed
It's not just my furniture you've rearranged
I was living in the past but somehow you brought me back
And I haven't felt like this since before Frankie said relax
And I know based on my track record
And I might not seen like the safest bet

Don't write me off just yet
For years I have been telling myself the same old story
That I happy to live off my so called former glories
But you given me a reason to take another chance
Now I need you despite the fact that you've killed all my plants
And I know that I've already blown more chances than anyone should ever get
All I'm asking you is don't write me off just yet
Don't write me out, just yet
